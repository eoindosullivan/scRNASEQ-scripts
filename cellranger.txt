## Command line seq work ## 

## 1. download the ref genome Curl -O http://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-cellranger-mm10-2.1.0.tar.gz ( i used wget the second time)
## 2. extract with tar -zf filename
## 3. wget the archive from seq facility ( use wget ftp//filenemae ) work on a staging node at all times. do this all in one sitting or shit breaks
## 4. Extract as above, but rename the archive first , wierd numbers and characters ("-" I think can sink the whole thing). I used $ mv file1.tar.gz file2.tar.gz
## 5. Each lane had all the reads archived also, which is a pain. use this gunzip *.gz to unzip and then delete the origional files.do each one individually.
## 6. ran out of room, so copy everything to the scratch space ( check the quota with $ quota ) 
## cp -R * /exports/cmvm/eddie/scs/groups/dferenba-seqdata /exports/eddie/scratch/sxxx

## 7. now open nova and save the script as name.sh next.

## 1_IRI-ABT  2_IRI-VEH  3_OLD  4_NAIVE  5_UUO

## the bash script:

#!/bin/bash
#$ -N novseneos5
#$ -cwd
#$ -pe sharedmem 8
#$ -l h_rt=48:00:00
#$ -l h_vmem=20G
#$ -e error.txt
#$ -o output.txt
. /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
module load igmm/apps/cellranger/2.1.0

## --expect-cells seems to be broken as an arguemnt soemtimes so removing it helped alot, but 5000 has worked in past and I think gives helps balance/bias the detected cells perhaps to each sample?.
## 8. then open up a normal session and $ qsub scriptname.sh
## 9. keep an eye on the situation with a qstat , should take some time queued (qw) then running (r) hopeulnot nor (e)rror
## 10. Review the error and output logs above to ensure all went well, should end with a "Pipestance completed successfully"



## this is the .csv for cellranger aggregate unix command but be warey of downsampling/nomralisation causing errors
